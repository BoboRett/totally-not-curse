### Totally Not Curse (TNC)
#### A World of Warcraft manager app thing

Hub for:
- Managing addons:
    - Keeping them up to date
    - (WIP) Installing from various sources (curse, tukui, git)
    - (WIP) Backing up addons/settings

This is just a pet project that is tested to the best of my ability. All risks associated with downloading some random piece of software off the internet stand (see [License](#License)).

Since I don't want to spend Â£500+ on signing the application, Windows SmartScreen will throw a fit when downloading and installing the app. The source code is all available to read above. Again, your own risk to take.
